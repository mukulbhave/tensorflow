Vehicle Identification(Viden)

The goal is to create a service to detect fraud in license plate usage by way of identifying vehicle  make, model and license plate number.Based on number fetch vehicle details from govt vehicle database using Vahan e-services and flag any discrepancy found.

We have created ML deep learning model to detect and fetch license plate number. The service is hosted at https://viden-n6rafmjufa-el.a.run.app
